The members realmester, ordinaryboyeee, and kyro2u were recently engaged in a discussion focusing on personal interests and gaming expertise. Realmester emphasized on the importance of an individual standing out with their interesting characteristics, to which ordinaryboyeee asked clarification about presenting traits in an online setting. The side chat branched out as kyro2u inquired about ordinaryboyeee's proficiency in certain games from chess to Minecraft and even intended to assess his Elo ranking in Bullet chess. Ordinaryboyeee boasted about his offline athletic accomplishments in football, track events like long jump and triple jump, fighting, even stating multiple instances where he surpassed a few challenging rivals in chess competitions. He largely seemed inclined towards becoming a Grandmaster (GM), which would require significant dedication playing chess up to 16 hours a day. Meanwhile, kyro2u showcased disinterest towards the game of chess and specified that he found it mundane, conversely pointing out that his sibling has quite the affinity towards the game. To wrap irony with a red ribbon, as ordinaryboyeee parried kyro2u's previously shared sentiment claiming chess being a stratagem of intellect, keen and far from monotony.
